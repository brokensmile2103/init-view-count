Count post views accurately via REST API with customizable display. Lightweight, fast, and extensible. Includes shortcode with multiple layouts.

== Description ==

**Init View Count** is a fast, clean plugin to track post views without clutter. It:

- Uses REST API and JS to count real views
- Prevents duplicate counts with session/local storage
- Stores counts in meta keys like `_init_view_count`, `_init_view_day_count`, etc.
- Provides `[init_view_count]` and `[init_view_list]` shortcodes
- Includes `[init_view_ranking]` shortcode with tabbed ranking by time range
- Supports template overrides (like WooCommerce)
- Lightweight. No tracking, no admin bloat.
- Includes REST API to query most viewed posts
- Supports pagination in `[init_view_list]` via the `page` attribute
- Batch view tracking support to reduce REST requests on busy sites
- Optional strict IP-based filtering to block fake view requests posted directly to the REST endpoint
- Now includes a Dashboard widget to monitor top viewed posts directly in wp-admin.

This plugin is part of the [Init Plugin Suite](https://en.inithtml.com/init-plugin-suite-minimalist-powerful-and-free-wordpress-plugins/) — a collection of minimalist, fast, and developer-focused tools for WordPress.

== Shortcodes ==

=== [init_view_count] ===  
Shows current view count for a post. Only works inside a post loop.

**Attributes:**
- `field`: `total` (default), `day`, `week`, `month` – which counter to display
- `format`: `formatted` (default), `raw`, or `short` – controls number formatting
- `time`: `true` to show time diff from post date (e.g. "3 days ago")
- `icon`: `true` to display a small SVG icon before the count
- `schema`: `true` to output schema.org microdata (InteractionCounter)
- `class`: add a custom CSS class to the outer wrapper

=== [init_view_list] ===  
Show list of most viewed posts.

**Attributes:**
- `number`: Number of posts to show (default: 5)
- `page`: Show a specific page of results (default: 1)
- `post_type`: Type of post (default: post)
- `template`: `sidebar` (default), `full`, `grid`, `details` (can be overridden)
- `title`: Title above list. Set to empty (`title=""`) to hide
- `class`: Custom class added to wrapper
- `orderby`: Sort field (default: meta_value_num)
- `order`: ASC or DESC (default: DESC)
- `range`: `total`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `trending`
- `category`: Filter by category slug
- `tag`: Filter by tag slug
- `empty`: Message to show if no posts found

=== [init_view_ranking] ===  
Show tabbed ranking of most viewed posts. Uses REST API and JavaScript for dynamic loading. Optimized for SPA/headless usage.

**Attributes:**
- `tabs`: Comma-separated list of ranges. Available: `total`, `day`, `week`, `month` (default: all)
- `number`: Number of posts per tab (default: 5)
- `class`: Custom class for outer wrapper

This shortcode automatically enqueues required JS and uses skeleton loaders while fetching data.

== REST API ==

This plugin exposes two REST endpoints to interact with view counts: one for recording views and another for retrieving top posts.

**`POST /wp-json/initvico/v1/count`**  
Record one or more views. Accepts a single post ID or an array of post IDs.

**Parameters:**
- `post_id` — *(int|array)* Required. One or more post IDs to increment view count for.

This endpoint checks if the post is published, belongs to a supported post type, and applies delay/scroll config (via JavaScript). It updates total and optionally day/week/month view counters.

Note: The number of post IDs processed per request is limited based on the batch setting in plugin options.

**`GET /wp-json/initvico/v1/top`**  
Retrieve the most viewed posts, ranked by view count.

**Parameters:**
- `range` — *(string)* `total`, `day`, `week`, `month`. Defaults to `total`.
- `post_type` — *(string)* Post type to query. Defaults to `post`.
- `number` — *(int)* Number of posts to return. Default: `5`.
- `page` — *(int)* Pagination offset. Default: `1`.
- `fields` — *(string)* `minimal` (id, title, link) or `full` (includes excerpt, thumbnail, type, date, etc.)
- `tax` — *(string)* Optional. Taxonomy slug (e.g. `category`).
- `terms` — *(string)* Comma-separated term slugs or IDs.
- `no_cache` — *(bool)* If `1`, disables transient caching.

This endpoint supports filtering and caching, and can be extended to support custom output formats.

== Template Override ==

To customize output layout, copy any template file into your theme:

Example: `your-theme/init-view-count/view-list-grid.php`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize the layout of the list? =  
Yes. Use the `template` attribute in `[init_view_list]` (e.g. `template="grid"`), and override the corresponding file in your theme like WooCommerce templates.

= Does it work with custom post types? =  
Yes. Just set `post_type="your_custom_type"` in the shortcode or REST query.

= How does it avoid duplicate views? =  
Init View Count uses both **time delay** and **scroll detection** via JavaScript, and stores viewed post IDs in either sessionStorage or localStorage (your choice).

= Is the view count updated immediately? =  
Yes. When the scroll+delay conditions are met, the count is updated via REST API and saved using `update_post_meta()`.

= What meta key is used to store views? =  
By default:  
- `_init_view_count` (total)  
- `_init_view_day_count`  
- `_init_view_week_count`  
- `_init_view_month_count`  
These keys can be changed via the `init_plugin_suite_view_count_meta_key` filter.
Trending scores are calculated separately and stored in a transient.

= Can I display view counts in my template manually? =  
Yes. Use `get_post_meta($post_id, '_init_view_count', true)` or similar keys. Or use `[init_view_count]` shortcode in post content.

= Can I disable the built-in CSS? =  
Yes. There is an option in the plugin’s settings to disable the default stylesheet. You can style the output manually as needed.

= Is it compatible with caching plugins? =  
Yes. Since it uses JavaScript + REST for counting, page caching doesn't interfere. However, REST responses (`/top`) are cached using transients.

= Can I use it in block editor / Gutenberg? =  
Yes. Just insert a Shortcode block and paste `[init_view_count]` or `[init_view_list]` as needed.

= Does it track bots? =  
No. Since counting only happens after scroll and delay via JavaScript, bots like Googlebot are naturally excluded.

= Can I sort posts by views in WP_Query? =  
Yes. Use `'meta_key' => '_init_view_count'` and `'orderby' => 'meta_value_num'` in your `WP_Query` args.

= Can I reduce the number of view requests sent to the server? =
Yes. You can enable batch view tracking in the plugin settings. Instead of sending one request per view, views will be stored in the browser and sent in a group once the threshold is reached.
