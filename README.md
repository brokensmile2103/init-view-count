## Overview

Init View Count lets you track and display real post views — not just page loads or fake numbers.  
It uses JavaScript + REST API to count only when the user actually scrolls and stays, and stores data in custom meta keys like `_init_view_count`.

With shortcode support, tabbed rankings, REST endpoints, and full template override capabilities, this plugin is perfect for blogs, magazines, content hubs, or anything in between.
